# Logo Generator

## Description
This was an assignment from my coding bootcamp, which did not come with any starter code. The requirements for the logo generator were as follows: 
* In the command line, the user is prompted with questions
* The user inputs are saved and used to generated a logo via SVG file
* The SVG file creates a 300x200px image that matches the user criteria

## Installation
You will need the following NPM libraries for this to run: 
* Inquirer
* Jest

## Instructions
After installing the required libraries, run the command ```node index.js" and answer the questions that are presented. Once the questions are answered, you should see a newly generated file appear. Open the SVG file's live server to view your new logo.
